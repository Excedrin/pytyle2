Dependencies:
    xpyb or xpyb-ng
    python >=2.4 (Not Python 3 compatible)

To install, simply run the following in this directory as root:

    python setup.py install

If Python 2 and Python 3 are installed side-by-side, you'll probably
want to run this instead:

    python2 setup.py install

PyTyle is meant to run in the background, so run it like so:

    pytyle2 &

You may want to add the above command to your ~/.xinitrc or
another startup script.

If you're having trouble running it on start up, try this in
your ~/.xinitrc:

    (sleep 5 && pytyle) &

It will give the window manager time to startup before PyTyle starts
asking it for information. Increase/decrease the sleep timeout
appropriately.

After PyTyle has been executed for the first time, it will create a
configuration file in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pytyle2/ directory (usually
~/.config/pytyle2) called config.ini. The comments in the configuration
file will explain everything.
